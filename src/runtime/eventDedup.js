/*! Open Historia — timeline event de-duplication © 2026 Nicholas Krol, AGPL-3.0-or-later (see LICENSE). */

// Why this exists: every jump the model is shown the running timeline as context
// (recentEvents / campaignHistory in promptContext.js) and, unless told otherwise,
// RESTATES events it already reported. Each restatement comes back as a NEW event
// object with a freshly-minted random id (generateId in gameState.js uses
// Date.now()+random), so an id-based de-dup can never match it — and the timeline
// ends up showing the "same" event over and over. De-dup on the event's CONTENT.
//
// Pure and dependency-free on purpose: the concat that creates the duplicates lives
// in shared client code ABOVE both the server and the in-browser stores, and this
// helper is unit-tested directly (eventDedup.test.js) without pulling in the
// browser-only asset layer that gameState.js imports.

const norm = (value) => String(value ?? "").trim();

// A stable content key. Only an EXACT restatement (same date AND title AND
// description) collides, so genuinely distinct events that merely share a date or a
// title are always kept — this can never drop real history, only literal repeats.
export const eventContentKey = (event) =>
  `${norm(event?.date)}\u0000${norm(event?.title).toLowerCase()}\u0000${norm(event?.description).toLowerCase()}`;

// Explicitly-authored transactions (notably the GM Console) need a stronger
// identity than visible prose. A correction can intentionally reuse the same
// date/title/description while changing canonical effects; treating that as a
// duplicate would reject the correction and the events write choke-point would
// otherwise silently remove it. Object key order is normalized so equivalent
// structured effects still compare equal. This key is NOT used by ordinary AI
// anti-repetition de-duplication, which deliberately remains prose-based.
